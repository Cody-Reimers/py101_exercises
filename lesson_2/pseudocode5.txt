Given two lists of numbers, "list1" and "list2"

Initialize integer variable "index" and list variable "new_list"
Iterate through both "list1" and "list2" simultaneously,
adding the element at "index" in "list1" to "new_list",
then the element at "index" in "list2" to "new_list".

Return the "new_list" to caller after done merging lists.

WHILE index <= length of list1
    add the element of list1 at index to new_list
    add the element of list2 at index to new_list
